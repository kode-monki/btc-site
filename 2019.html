            <h2>Bible Translation and Embodiment: Incarnation as a Metaphor for Translation.</h2>
            <p>This presentation will review important metaphors for translation including “metaphor” as a metaphor for
                translation and “equivalence” as a metaphor. It will then focus on exploring “incarnation” as a
                productive metaphor for Bible translation in light of the incarnation of God in Jesus Christ and in
                light of much recent discussion of the embodied nature of human thought and language. Special attention
                will be given to examples of various ways metaphors relate to embodied existence in different contexts
                (including biblical contexts and receptor contexts) and to the importance of respecting various roles
                metaphors play not only in source texts but also within the linguistic and literary systems of the
                receptor community in which the word of God is being newly “incarnated.” Practical examples will be
                discussed.</p>

            <h2>Bible Translation and Embodiment: Incarnational Mission vs. Docetic Conceptions of the Work of Bible
                Translation.</h2>
            <p>This presentation will discuss in further detail ways in which the metaphor of incarnation (or
                incarnational mission) might helpfully inform the work of Bible translators. It will consider how
                different modes of Bible translation (whether print, audio, visual/dramatic, sign language or others)
                represent particular instantiations of the embodied communication of divine revelation by and for people
                in particular contexts as well as the relationship between the incarnational mission of the translated
                text and the incarnational mission of translators as texts “written on the heart.” The implications of a
                contrast between incarnational and docetic metaphors for translation (with the latter assuming
                translators produce disembodied words untainted by human culture or characteristics of the individual(s)
                producing them) will be explored in light of particular examples.</p>

            <h2>Bible Translation as Incarnation of the Word of God: Transformational Power Through Form and Meaning
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Marlon Winedt</strong></p>
            <p>“This thing does not speak to me, I cannot hear it”, said the Inca Atahualpa angrily, as he threw the
                Bible on the ground, after literally putting it to his ear to no avail. The Holy book was given to him
                by the Spanish fraile as part of his ‘translation’ of Christianity to the emperor, in the context of the
                conquista, where the strong arm of the Spanish monarchy misused the contents and the materiality of the
                Good Book to encourage and then justify the destruction of peoples, cultures and lands.</p>
            <p>Indeed, Bible translation is not a neutral, soulless activity divested of any moral, spiritual or
                cultural claim or responsibility. Form has often distorted its meaning, but felicitously its meaning has
                often created new hybrid forms in different cultures. This paper addresses the incarnational aspect of
                Bible Translation from three perspectives:</p>
            <p>First, there is a need for a philosophical-theological account of the dialectical relationship between
                form and meaning on different levels and how it relates to Bible Translation as a genre.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we will touch upon the relationship between different types of embodied performance, oral and
                written translation, as part of the same (inter)semiotic continuum, despite socio-cultural factors which
                have led to the denial of multi-modality.</p>
            <p>Last but not least, Bible Translation must deliberately lead to the appropriation of Scripture through
                the community’s culture, so that its transformational power can be unleashed. And the culturally
                embodied performance of Scripture truly shows the way forward to an encounter with Him who is the Word
                of God. Bible translation will only then be able to continue divesting the conquistador’s clothes, thus
                accepting the validity of different forms which recreate its meaning.</p>

            <h3>Special Plenary </h3>
            <h2>Bible Translation as Incarnation of the Word of God:  Transformational Power Through Form and Meaning</h2>
            <p><strong>Michel Kenmogne, </strong>SIL Executive Director</p>
            <p>The drastic changes that we continue to observe in the global tapestry of the Church, minority languages and other sociological factors are significantly affecting the understanding of what Bible translation is or should be. Consequently, the training, resourcing, and implementing systems of Bible translation need a deep reappraisal in the light of these shifts. I would like to submit that our exploration of the question “who needs Scripture” should assume that language communities around the world would be located on the continuum of at least three broad contexts in terms of the function that translation might serve. Therefore, the attempt to address the question of “who needs Scripture?” should begin with a re-evaluation of the assumptions that we hold about the function of Bible translation. While Bible translation is a task for all generations of the Church, the role that it plays differs from one context to another. Therefore, BT will be most effective when it is pursued through strategies and approaches that adapt- sooner rather than later- to the changes occurring within the community.</p>
            <p>Among the drastic changes, the growing reality of multilingualism also mandates a reconsideration of how to make decisions concerning translation needs assessment, translation strategies, translation products and media in response to the context and realities and needs of each language community. Ultimately, no single stakeholder can determine these factors in isolation. It will take new collaborative mechanisms to provide appropriate responses to the new assumptions raised by multilingualism. In the process, it is understood that translation does not serve the same functions across the board, which requires that we all pay attention to the planning processes that involve double loop learning.</p>
