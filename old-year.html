        <h1>Ethics in Translation</h1>
        <p>The theme will be ‘Ethics in Bible Translation’, picking up a topic being explored by the FOBAI Translation Development Group this year. </p>
        <p>We all get involved in Bible translation for different reasons, not least a sense of calling and desire to serve, while doing good and working towards transformation in peoples’  lives. However, this motivation does not exempt us from ethical considerations about our systems, practices, methods and strategies. What ethical lenses do we use to examine how we do what we do? Where does Bible translation intersect with issues like respect, justice, fairness, concern for the vulnerable, minimising harm, and avoiding control and exploitation? </p>
        <p>As you begin to think about, research and prepare for BT 2025, we offer the following sub-themes:

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Ethics of People and Communities</h3>
            <p>This lens focuses on the people involved in Bible Translation, including the language communities themselves,
                translators, facilitators, advisors, consultants, etc. We each participate in different ways and each role
                deserves ethical examination. Translation also involves wider communities. Best practices and strategies
                take shape in particular contexts. What are the ethical issues involved with such contextualization?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Ethics of Technology and Processes</h3>
            <p>Technology and Bible translation have a long history, from the inventions of writing, early books, the
                printing press, computers, to machine assisted translation and AI. New technology is emerging faster than
                ever before. What are the ethical issues we need to consider as we develop and use technology? What about
                other aspects of the translation process? Strategies for drafting, checking, and distributing also deserve
                an ethical appraisal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Ethics of Finances, Leadership and Communication </h3>
            <p>Translation involves cultural mediation where there are often differences of power and differing cultural
                concepts of goal setting. Funding, decision making, quality assurance, access to resources, and messaging
                about activities and impact are some of the areas we need to consider. What are the ethical implications of
                such power relations?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Ethics of Interpretation and Exegesis</h3>
            <p>Bible Translation always involves interpretation, and is shaped by our theological persuasions. What are the
                ethical frames that guide our practices and the ways we carry out exegesis? </p>
