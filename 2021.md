# Paradigms of Bible Translation: Mission, Goals and Assumptions

**October 15-19, 2021** 

## About the Theme

The theme ‘Paradigms of Bible translation’ intends to deepen our understanding of translation principles and practices that are followed by translation practitioners from different backgrounds. It aims to build mutual understanding and a higher degree of consensus regarding best practices in Bible translation. The presentations are expected to foster constructive dialogue and avoid judgmental criticism of other positions.

**Relevance of the theme**

Different communities and individuals may have different expectations with regard to what Bible translation is and how it should be done. Sometimes these differences lead to misunderstanding, distrust, lack of collaboration, or even controversy.

Examples:

* Literal translation vs. idiomatic, meaning-based translation vs. contextualized translation  
    
* Linguistic translation vs. cultural translation  
    
* Focus on print translation vs. audio-based (oral) translation  
    
* Church-based translation vs. pioneering, missionary translation  
    
* Experts-driven translation vs. participatory forms of translation  
    
* Quality-driven translation vs. acceleration & innovation driven translation  
    
* Translation in the vernacular language vs. translation in multilingual contexts  
    
* Computer-aided translation vs. human translation

Reflection on the various paradigms of translation may help us to gain a better understanding of ourselves and of others as we engage in the challenging task of Bible translation and Scripture engagement on a global scale. It may help us to develop a greater sense of appreciation for the variety of approaches that complement one another as they fulfil the needs of different audiences living in diverse cultural, social, and linguistic contexts. It may also lead to a higher degree of commitment to working together toward the eradication of Bible poverty in the world.

## Sub-Themes

1\. History of Bible translation

2\. The theory & practice of Bible translation today (includes theology, contextualization)

3\. Training & mentoring

4\. Technology & innovation

5\. Scripture engagement & media (includes orality)

6\. Partnering, funding, recruitment & management related to Bible translation

7\. Francophone Translation Track

## Some questions to be addressed: 

**What is the Bible?**  
Different individuals/organizations/churches may have different perspectives on this: NT only, OT plus NT, OT plus NT plus apocrypha, role of the Septuagint, multimodality, print vs audio/orality, etc.

**What is Bible translation?**  
Different perspectives on what Bible translations should look like, and what the limits of translation as a genre are: literal vs. meaning-based, idiomatic, translation principles. Can a translation be accurate if it is unnatural and unclear, leading to misunderstanding? Different ways translations function: including use in liturgy, Bible study, evangelism, etc. Whole Bible translation

**What can we learn from the history of Bible translation?**  
What are the different paradigms that we find in the history of Bible translation? What can we learn from the history of Bible translation? What can we learn from various theories of translation/communication?

**To what degree does our theology shape the way we translate?**  
Is this good or bad?  Our theology, missiology, hermeneutics, Western understanding versus non-Western understanding of the text. What can we learn from one another?

**How does Bible translation relate to Scripture engagement, media, technology, linguistics, anthropology?** 

**What is a good model of collaboration in Bible translation?**   
How can we promote (better) unity in diversity? What are opportunities for better collaboration? What are some of the major challenges? How can they be overcome?

**Paradigms, Paradigm Shifts and Paradigm Conflicts in Bible Translation: Insights, Questions and Possible Answers from Translation Studies**  
*Dr. Sameh Hanna \- United Bible Societies*

The idea of ‘paradigm’ was first developed and promoted by the philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn (1962), as a conceptual tool that explains how a particular discipline of knowledge functions synchronically and develops diachronically. It was later borrowed into translation studies by Theo Hermans in the mid-1980s to introduce the then emerging descriptivist and systemic approach to translation as “a new paradigm in translation studies” (1985: 7). Although Kuhn did not give a neat definition of the concept, it was generally understood as “a model of scientific achievement that sets guidelines for research”, and as “a means for conducting research on a particular problem, a problem-solving device” (Crane 1972: 7, 29, cited in Hermans 1999: 9). A paradigm, in this sense, informs the theoretical assumptions underpinning the design of methodologies, conceptual tools and research programmes. With its double focus on theory and practice, any given paradigm is keen to foster solutions for real, practical problems. Over time, a dominant paradigm in a field becomes unable to accommodate theoretical contradictions, resolve paradoxes, nor answer practical challenges. This is when a crisis in that field emerges, and a new paradigm is needed. The moment of crisis involves a tension between the old, decaying paradigm and the new one which aspires to embrace the questions left unanswered. 

How does the concept of ‘paradigm’ help us map the conceptual topography of Bible translation, its theory and practice? How does it help in understanding the field of Bible translation at any given point in time, its dominant practices, key players (both individuals and institutions) and its underlying dichotomies (theory/practice, meaning/form, text/context, literalism/communicativeness, local-church centric/missionary-translator centric)? And how does it help us to understand the historical development of that field, its moments of crisis, changing modes of practice and transitions between old and new paradigms? Most importantly, how is disagreement and difference managed and negotiated at moments of crisis when two translation paradigms collide with their two different sets of theoretical assumptions about language, meaning and communication?

This paper seeks to facilitate a dialogue between Bible translation and translation studies in their most recent developments. In his latest publication, Contra Instrumentalism: A Translation Polemic (2019) Venuti captures all the paradigms (he uses the term ‘translation models’) that shaped translation theory and practice in two: the instrumentalist vs. the hermeneutic. Using Venuti’s latest work, among others, as well as examples of Bible translation in Arabic and English, in print editions and audio-visual formats, provisional answers to the above questions will be attempted.
